Men and women alike starving, their eyes red and mad with hunger.{newline}{newline}You can't help but feel the bleakness of life and the quiet despair that fills it. Your resolve to help these people stokes the fire within you, your desire to be good.{newline}{newline}You will help these people, there is no doubt. You will donate what you can."/>

Please spread your kindness to others as you have done here.&quot;{newline}{newline}Astonished, you look around the crowd and see in each person's face a smile that lights the sky.{newline}{newline}Gratified by the virtue of these people, you accept the crowds wishes and continue on for there are still those in need." />

You divert course hoping to save as many as possible.{newline}{newline}As you enter the village, savagery beyond recognition is displayed, the details too horrifying to speak of. Those remaining have nothing left. Their homes, their families, their loved ones, gone.{newline}{newline}There is nothing that can be done to stop their suffering, but to leave helpless would be an immoral act, one that cannot be washed away. It would go against every principle of your being.{newline}{newline}As you watch the villagers carry their dead, you realize you can help. Immediately, you command your men to help carry their dead and rebuild their home. " />
