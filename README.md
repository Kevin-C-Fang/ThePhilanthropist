# ThePhilanthropist

Bannerlord mod with goal of roleplaying as a philanthropist. By donating to the settlements inhabitants, you can increase the settlements prosperity.

Currently, the mod only allows donation to towns and villages with a cap of 5000 for towns and 600 for villages.

Plan on implementing:
1. Donating gold to notables to increase power which will increase odds of higher tier troops
2. Donating gold to rebuild a village after being raided
3. Player can be ambushed somehow because his donations have attracted greedy eyes
