# ThePhilanthropist

Bannerlord mod with goal of roleplaying as a philanthropist.

Features:
- Donate to towns/villages to increase prosperity. Prosperity Cap: Town(5000), Village(600)
- Help rebuild a raided village where time to rebuild is based on troop strength.

Plan on implementing:
1. Donating gold to notables to increase power which will increase odds of higher tier troops
2. Settings menu to adjust factors such as gold to prosperity ratio, prosperity cap, etc.
3. Player can be ambushed somehow because his donations have attracted greedy eyes
